## Dev Meetup Slides

Slides starter built with the Next.js App Router. Everything is stripped back so you can focus on content and motion design for the meetup presentation.

### Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

Edit `app/page.tsx` to craft your slides. Add your own components in `app` or `lib`. Tailwind CSS is ready to go out of the box.

### Deploying

Deploy wherever you prefer to host Next.js apps (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
